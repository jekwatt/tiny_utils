# single_and_multi_lined_docstrings.txt

# In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote(""")
# string format.
# This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not.
# At a bare minum, a docstring shoudl be a quick summary of whatever is it
# you're describing and should be contained within a single line.

# Single-lined docstring example:
"""This is a quick summary line used as description of the object."""

# Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary.
# All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:
# - A one-line summary line
# - A blank line proceeding the summary
# - Any further elaboration for the docstring
# - Another blank line

# Multi-lined docstring example:
"""This is the summary line

This is the further elaboration of the docstring.  Within this section,
you can elaborate further on details as appropriate for the situation.
Notice that the summary and the elaboration is separated by a blank new
line.
"""

# Notice the blank line above.  Code should continue on this line.
