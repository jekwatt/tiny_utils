# Commenting code via type hinting (Python 3.5+).
# Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the reader of your code.
# It allows the developer to design and explain portions of your code without commenting.

Here's a simple example:

def hello_name(name: str) -> str:
    return(f"Hello {name}")
